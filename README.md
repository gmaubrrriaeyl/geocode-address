Project geocodes given  .csv of addresses. Currently, can get lat/long from Google Maps API, can write to .csv so you don't have to re-do expensive API operation. Currently working out problem of duplicate geocodes. Future would like to change to Open Maps API since google does not allow for scaling up.
